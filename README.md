# European Pets Viz

Hello everyone! This is my really first project on data viz during my learning journey. In the Europe_Pets_Markdown.md I share a R based Markdown on how to make a simple but beautiful visualization on the rate of dogs/cats per 100 in the different european countries. We'll learn how to:

* Import the relevant libraries we need
* Make tranformations to our data in order to have the database prepared for plotting
* Make a beautiful ploting using coloured bars and flag point representing each country

As this is my first contribution, Iâ€™m sure that my code could have some improvable things, or that anything could be made in a more efficient way. Be free to share any comments, suggestions or whatever in order to improve my work! You can also find the dataset I used, so you can try to make it by your own.

Thank You!
